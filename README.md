# Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

This project contains various mini-tasks that use core concepts of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a detailed understanding of how these technologies work together. By engaging with these examples, learners can explore different features of these languages and enhance their knowledge.

## HTML Concepts

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web pages. It defines the structure of content on the page. This project uses different HTML tags to create various elements like buttons, forms, and images.

- Structuring the page using elements like `<div>`, `<p>`, and `<h1>`.
- Creating forms with input fields like `<input>` and `<button>` for user interaction.
- Using links with `<a>` tags to navigate between pages or perform actions.

## CSS Concepts

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the HTML elements to create visually appealing web pages. This project includes CSS for layout, coloring, and responsive designs.

- Styling elements with CSS classes and IDs.
- Using Flexbox for a responsive layout.
- Customizing fonts, colors, and spacing to enhance readability.

## JavaScript Concepts

JavaScript is used to make web pages interactive. It provides the functionality to respond to user inputs and create dynamic elements. This project contains various examples of JavaScript usage.

- Using `onClick` events to trigger actions when buttons are clicked.
- Implementing form validation and encryption algorithms (like Shift, Vigen√®re, and Affine ciphers) using JavaScript.
- Modifying DOM elements dynamically based on user input.
